## About the Project
This project was developed as part of our semester-wise project under **Team 7**. It was created during the semester when we learned Python, aiming to implement our programming skills in a fun and interactive way.

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to slide tiles in the desired direction.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
- Reach 2048 to win the game!
- The game ends when no more moves are possible.

Enjoy the game and challenge yourself to reach 2048!
